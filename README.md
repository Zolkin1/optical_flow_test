This is a bare bones code structure that can be expanded for use in a bigger project.

The HAL drivers were generated from CubeMX - they could probably be pulled from the GitHub but I don't think thats necessary.

Here is the entire process (in case you are copying this directory):
1. Copy everything except the cmake-build-debug folder
1. Write your code in main.c and main.h (the cmake file can be adjusted so more custom files can be used). Feel free to delete stuff generated by CubeMX since you won't use CubeMX again to re-generate code. Ideally, you can just write the HAL drivers yourself.
1. Then use `mkdir cmake-build-debug` to make the build-debug folder. I am using out of source cmake building
1. `cd cmake-build-debug`
1. `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
1. `cmake --build .` can also add `-- -j 4` to multithread the process
1. In this folder, start `JLinkExe`
1. In `JLinkExe` type `connect`
    1. The default options should be fine, so you can just hit enter through all of them
    1. Then`loadfile <filename>.bin 0x8000000`
    1. You can also verify it with `verifybin <filename>.bin 0x8000000`
1. In a different terminal window start `JLinkGDBServer`
1. In another terminal window start `gdb-multiarch` (can also use --tui if you want)
    1. Then use `file <filename>.elf` to load the elf
    1. `target remote localhost:2331` to connect to the local gdb server
    1. Feel free to add breakpoints at this point
    1. `monitor reset`
    1. `c` and this should bring you to your first breakpoint
1. After you make changes to the source, you should only need to run the `cmake --build .` command, the `loadfile <filename>.bin 0x8000000` command, and and gdb stuff again. Creating the directories is a one time thing
